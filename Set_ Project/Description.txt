"Set" Project - 10th Grade, 2015-2016
AP Computer Science Final Project

This was my final project for AP Computer Science in my sophomore year of high school.
Our only prompt for the project was to create something using Java.
Most people in the class wanted to create games (myself included),
so after a week of thought, I decided to recreate the card game "Set."

In this folder, I've included the source code for my two drafts (developed in the BlueJ
environment) and the executable jar file.
